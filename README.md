# Lyapunov optimization
Codes for :  
    `"Lyapunov Optimization for Energy Harvesting Wireless Sensor Communications",`  
    `"Lyapunov Optimized Cooperative Communications With Stochastic Energy Harvesting Relay"` and  
    `"Lyapunov-Optimized Two-Way Relay Networks With Stochastic Energy Harvesting"`  
  
The following libraries have been used in the code:
1.) Math
2.) Numpy
3.) Gym
4.) Time
5.) EH_P2P (using the python code "EH_P2P.py")

The dataset was obtained from internet and all the csv files are available in the folder named as MDP_Optimal_Policy_BER - Multiple Power - Selective DF".


The python code is available in "APL452_P3_Lyapunov.py" and the output csv is saved as "APL452_Project3_Lyapunov_0.csv"
